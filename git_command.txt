Git Branch

On the high level, there are two concepts: your local branch and the remote branch
    1. List all branch: git branch
    2. Create a local branch: git branch <your local branch name>
    2. Switch between branches: git checkout <your local branch name>
    3. Make sure you are pushing and pulling from the right branch
        Push: git push -u origin <local_branch>
            Note that in our case, our remove_branch and local_branch are the same
                E.g., git push -u origin tony_brach
    4. To merge two branches. Note that in reality, you should create a Pull Request on GitHub 
        first for everyone to review and approve before merging.
        * Push to your branch
        * git checkout main 
        * git pull origin main - this is to make sure your main is up to date
        * git merge <current_branch> - this will complete the merge step
        * git checkout main
        * git push -u <current_branch> main - push the newest changes to main
