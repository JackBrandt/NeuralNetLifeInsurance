Git Branch

On the high level, there are two concepts: your local branch and the remote branch
    1. List all branch: git branch
    2. Create a local branch: git branch <your local branch name>
    2. Switch between branches: git checkout <your local branch name>
    3. Make sure you are pushing and pulling from the right branch
        Push: git push -u origin <local_branch>
            Note that in our case, our remove_branch and local_branch are the same
                E.g., git push -u origin tony_brach
