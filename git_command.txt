Git Branch
    1. Create a branch: git branch <name>
    2. Switch between branches: git checkout <name>
    3. Make sure you are pushing and pulling from the right branch
        Push: git push -u <remote_branch> <local_branch>
            Note that in our case, our remove_branch and local_branch are the same
                E.g., git push -u tony_branch tony_brach
