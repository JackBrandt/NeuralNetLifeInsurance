TODO List

TODO: Create neural nets for people over 25,
    that is train a neural net on the mortality rates, given the person doesn't die when 25
    then repeat for the next year up and so on, this means a lot of neural nets to train/store/use
    but we probably don't need to do every possible neural net, i.e., we can stop once a certain age is reached

TODO: Add the possibility to have life insurance that has an age limit, e.g., a policy that runs for 20 years or death
    whatever comes first

TODO: Create a policy database

TODO: Finish web API

TODO: Update function/file headers

TODO: Fix neural net so that the saved version has been trained on all of the data instead of only 80% of instead

TODO: Decide on loss function

TODO: Split big function into several smaller functions (e.g., actu_eval)
