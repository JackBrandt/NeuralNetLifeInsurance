Project Proposal: Life Insurance Risk Prediction Model

Project Objective:
Develop a machine learning model to estimate the probability of an individual passing away in a given year of life based on relevant health, medical history, and lifestyle factors. Utilize these probability estimates to inform life insurance pricing strategies.

Scope and Approach:

Collect and preprocess data from reputable sources, including demographic, medical, and lifestyle variables.
Explore various machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods, to model mortality risk.
Validate model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision-recall, and calibration plots.
Apply actuarial principles to translate risk predictions into competitive life insurance pricing strategies.
